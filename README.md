# dron
Dron game coded on Python/Pygame

Your dron is in enemy's field. Your mission is to take photos of the enemy's bases and panzers. 
To take a photo you need to place the dron completely over the target. If it is a base, your
velocity must be very small. If it is a panzer the dron can be traveling at any speed. When 
the requirements are fulfilled the photo is automatically taken and the target gets dark.
Be careful to avoid any missil or bullet the enemy throws at you, and to no get out of fuel!
When you are done, a rescue platform will appear. You have to land on it at a small purely
horizontal speed.

To play, execute the file dron.py under python3 with the numpy & pygame libraries installed.
Have fun!
